Lesson - Amazon CloudWatch Overview
    - CloudWatch Metric: time-ordered data sent from services like EC2
        => collect it, graph it and response to that information
        => Unified CloudWatch Agent to monitor memory and disk usage
            => without this, default metrics sent by EC2 do not include memory/disk usage
        => Every 5 minutes (free) / Every 1 minutes (chargeable)
        => Also works for every AWS services 
        => publish custom metrics using CLI or API
    - CloudWatch Alarms: monitor metrics and initiate actions
        => ex) Auto Scaling Group
        => Metrics alarm: performs one or more actions based on single metric
        => Composite alarm: uses a rule expression and takes into account multiple alarms 
    - CloudWatch Logs: centralized collection of system and application logs 
    - CloudWatch Events: Stream of system events describing changes to AWS resources and can trigger actions 
        => EventBridge is basically the same thing

Lesson - Amazon CloudWatch Logs
    - Gather application and system logs in CloudWatch
    - Defined expiration policies and KMS encryption
    - Send to: S3(export), Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Data Firehose
    - Get logs from EC2/On-premises servers => install Unified CloudWatch Agent
    - Lambda/AWS services => will require permissions to write/read on CloudWatch Logs
    - ElasticSearch service => Real-time log processing with subscription filters

Lesson - The Unified CloudWatch Agent
    - Collect internal system-level metrics from EC2 / on-premises servers across OS
    - Sends log information in near real-time 
    - ex) If EC2 was to be terminated for some reason, you'll lose why it was terminated. 
        => but with Agent, you'll have log from real-time of what happened
    - Difference with standard metrics
        1) with Agent in Windows, information included in Windows Performance Monitor will be included in CloudWatch
        2) Linux and macOS: metrics associated with utilization on-disk-level and memory metrics

Lesson - AWS CloudTrail
    - Capture API action happening in AWS accounts for auditing purpose
    - API actions are generated by every actions in AWS services (management console, API, CLI...)
    - retained for 90 days; Use CloudTrail Trail for logging to S3 for indefinite retention
    - within Region or all Regions; can trigger with API calls; stream event to CloudWatch Logs
    - Management events - who generated what API action on what resource
    - Data events - what operations are performed on/in a resource; detailed information
    - Insights events - identify and respond to unuaual activity associated with API calls
    
Lesson - Amazon EventBridge / CloudWatch Events (Refresher) 
    - Event Sources sneds Events => Event bus picks them up => Rules will determine what to do with Event / which Target to send to

Lesson - Metric Analysis and Tracing
    AWS X-Ray: visualize components of application; identify performance bottlenecks; troubleshoot request that errored
        => good for microservice application
        => trace data => will generate the service map and searchable trace summaries 
        => EC2, ECS, Lambda and Elastic Beanstalk
        => must integrate the X-Ray SDK with your application and install the X-Ray agent
        => X-Ray SDK captures metadata for request made to MySQL and PostgreSQL and DynamoDB
            => Also captures metadata made to SQS and SNS 
    Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus:
        - open-source monitoring system and time series database
        - use Prometheus query language (PromQL) to monitor/alert performance of containerized workloads
        - Integrated with EKS, ECS, AWS Distro 
    Amazon Managed Grafana
        - Grafana is an open-source analytics and monitoring solution for databases
        - provides interactive data visualization for monitoring and operational data
        - integrates with AWS SSO and SAML
        - ex) Grafana dashboard can visualize data from AWS X-Ray as a data source 
        - ex) import MySQL dashboard and visualize
