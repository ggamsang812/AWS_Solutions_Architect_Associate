AWS Directory Service
    - Active directory / Simple AD - Database of user accounts and credentials
        => for authentication and authorization
    AWS Managed Microsoft AD:
        - Deploy Highly Available Windows Server Domain Controllers (DCs) in the VPC
            => just create the Directory Service in the console and it will deploy DCs to the subnets
        - Connect to Microsoft AD over the VPN connection and create one or two-way trust relationship
            => authentication working across different domain
        - Can connect to EC2 Linux and Windows instances to DCs; join the Active Directory domain
        - Connect to Azure Cloud / O365 with ADSync ADFS
    AD Connector:
        - when you have existing AD in on-premise environment
        - Use VPN / Direct Connect to connect to AD Connector
            => Sign-in to Amazon WorkSpaces / AWS Management Console
        - Seamlessly join Windows EC2 to an on-premise AD domain
    Simple AD: 
        - Inexpensive AD-compatible service with common directory features
        - best choice for less than 5000 users and don't need advanced AD features
        
Identity Providers and Federation
    - Federation = we take our identity source and link it with AWS 
    SAML 2.0 Identity Federation:
        - AD is in the LDAP Identity Store
        - Active Directory Federation Service (ADFS) is an Identity Provider (IdP)
        - IdP sends client SAML assertion => App calls AWS STS to assume role 
            => STS returns temporary security credentials => app accesses AWS
    Web Identity Federation:
        - This case we have Social Identity Providers (IdPs) => Amazon, Google, Facebook logins
        - Identity source can be Open ID Connect (OIDC)
        - AWS recommends to use Cognito for Web Identity Federation in most cases
    IAM Identity Center (known as AWS SSO)
        - Have our own identity source that uses SAML 2.0
        - Work with AD Connector or AWS Managed Microsoft AD
        - Connect to AWS Organizations
    Amazon Cognito:
        - For web or mobile applications
        - Cognito User Pool => responsible for authenticating user by talking to Social IdPs
            => return with Token returned (Java Web Token - JWT) => app sends JWT to Cognito Identity Pool (CIP)
            => CIP talk to STS => Token gets exchanged for temp security credentials
            => app now talks to AWS services 

Amazon Cognito
    - User Pool: where you can create users and identities
        => or you can federate with your social IdPs 
    - Identity Pool: responsible for getting temporary credentials from the AWS STS 
        => exchange JWT tokens for AWS credentials

Encryption Primer
    Encryption In Transit:
        - encrypting data as it travels the network
        - actual data inside the encrypted channel may not be encrypted
        - only encrypted while it's traveling the network
        - Once it arrives it may or may not be encrypted => this depends on Encryption at Rest
    Encryption At Rest:
        - channel over the network and actual data itself is encrypted and stored encrypted
    Asymmetric Encryption:
        - pulic key cryptography => have pulic key and private key 
        - to decrypt public key => need private key; for decrypt private key => need pulic key
        - ex) SSL/TLS and SSH
        - person with public key can encrypt; person with private key can decrypt
    Symmetric Encryption:
        - single key used for encryption and decryption  

AWS Key Management Service (KMS)
    - create and manage symmetric and asymmetric encryption keys 
    - protected by hardware security modules (HSMs)
    - Developer creates "customer managed" KMS keys vs. AWS managed keys for keys created/managed by AWS
    - KMS keys are primary resources in AWS KMS; known as "customer master keys" or CMKs
    - KMS key can encrypt data up to 4KB in size which is small
        => for bigger data => Data Encryption Keys(DEKs) => KMS key can encrypt/decrypt DEKs
    - External Key Store(XKS) => store outside of AWS to meet regulatory requirements
        => with XKS, key material never leaves HSM
    - Custom Key Store => in an AWS CloudHSM custom key store
        => cryptography performed sole in CloudHSM cluster you own and manage
        => not Available for asymmetric KMS keys 
    - know KMS Keys and automatic rotation:
        => Key ID stays the same and only the Key material changes
            => application can still use the same key ID; no need change application 
        => Automatic key rotation do not change the property of KMS key: Key ID, key ARM, region, policies, and permission
            => doesn't work for: Asymmetric KMS keys; HMAC KMS keys; custom key stores(outside of HSM); imported key material
                => need to manually rotate
    - Key policy defines management and usage permissions for KMS keys 
        => multiple policy can be combined to specifiy separate administrative and usage permissions
        => Grants are useful for temporary permission => delegating use of the key 
    ***Exam Tips***:
    - To share snapshots with another account: specify Decrypt and CreateGrant permission
    - kms:ViaService condition key can be used to limit key usage to specific AWS service
    - removing the ability to decrypt => Cryptography erasure => for imported key material
        => DeleteImportedKeyMaterial API: if data has been exposed and to prevent decryption of data
            => will never be possible to decrypt that data 
        => InvalidKeyID exception when using SSM Parameter Store indicates the KMS key is not enabled
    - AWS managed vs. customer managed KMS keys
    - Automatic vs. Manual rotation
