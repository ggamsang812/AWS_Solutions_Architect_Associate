    Lesson - Amazon CloudFront Caching and Behaviors
        - Regional Edge Cache is located between Edge location and CloudFront Origins
            => there are 12 regional edge caches with larger cache bandwidth for holding more contents
        - TTL is default to 24 hrs; Decreasing the TTL is best for Dynamic content; Increasing TTL is better for performance and reducing load on origin
        - You can specify the path pattern (behaviors) determines where to send the request
            => .jpg to origin1; .mp4 to origin2; and default to origin1
        - can configure CloudFront to forward headers in the viewer request to the origin
            => CloudFront can then cache multiple versions of an object based on the values in one or more request headers
        1) Forward all headers to your origin (objects are not cached)
        2) Forward a whitelist of headers that you specify
        3) Forward only the default headers (doesn't cache objects based on values in request headers)
    
    Lesson - CloudFront Signed URLs and OAI/OAC
        Signed URLs:
        - Provide more control over access to content 
        - signed URL provided by serverless application (ex.lambda) => application will use this URL to access distribution
        - should be used for individual files and clients that don't support cookies 
        Signed Cookies:
        - similar to signed URLs but used when you don't want to change URLs
        - used when you want to provide access to multiple restricted files (NOT for individual files)
        OAI:
        - For custom origin with S3 bucket configured as static website 
        - Essentially like a user account within CloudFront and the bucket policy will only allow access from this user account
            => Bucket policy "principle" will have specific OAI 
            => No other CloudFront with different OAI or the user won't be able to reach the origin
        - This has been deprecated
        OAC:
        - OAI but more additional use cases; AWS recommands this instead of OAI
        - Also requires an S3 bucket policy but a little different from OAI
            => under "principle", service will be just CloudFront and under "Condition", it will have arn of the specific CloudFront
    
    Lesson - CloudFront SSL/TLS and Server Name Indication(SNI)
        - Can have SSL through AWS Certificate Manager(ACM) / 3rd parth CA => must be issued in us-east-1 for CloudFront certificate
        - default CF domain name can be changed using CNAMES 
        - S3 Origin => has its own certificate already => can connect to it using HTTPS => cannot be changed
        - Custom Origin => certificate can be ACM for ALB / third-party for EC2
        - Origin certificates must be public certificate
        SNI:
        - Multiple certificates share the same IP with SNI 
        - Have multiple SSL/TLS certificates which corresponds with different domain names running on the same IP address on the CF
        - usually will have to buy different IP address on CF, but not with SNI 
        - works with browers/clients released after 2010 - otherwise need dedicated IP 
    
    Lesson - Lambda @ Edge
        - Run Node.js and Python Lambda functions to customize the content CF delivers
        - executes functions closer to the viewer
        - Can be run at the following points:
            1) After CloudFront receives a request from a viewer (viewer request)
            2) Before CloudFront forwards the request  to the origin (origin request)
            3) After CF receives the response from the origin (origin response)
            4) Before CF forwards the response to the viewer (viewer response)

    Lesson - AWS Global Accelerator(GA)
        - Utilize the AWS Global Network to send data to your application
            => means avoiding the internet for large part of the data transfer 
            => you get better bandwidth, latency and a lot of consistencies (much more than pulic internet)
