AWS Migration Tools Overview 
    - will usually talk about migrating service and transferring data from on-premise to AWS
    - will need VPN, Direct Connect or Internet to connect corporate data center to AWS
    - AWS Migration Hub: Monitor migrations that use AWS or partner tools

AWS Application Discovery Service
    - Collect data about servers in on-premises Data Center (DC)
        => hostname, IP address, resource allocation and utilization detail on CPU, network, memory and disk
    - use Agentless discovery(OVA) to deploy and connect to vCenter (VMware)
        => Discovery Connector for VMware
    - (Discovery Agent) Agent-based discovery for Windows/Linux, Hyper-V, Physical
        => can use both for mixture case (for VMware and Windows?)
    - Data can be saved to S3 and queried with Athena/QuickSight
    
AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)
    - To migrate database into AWS data serive (ex. RDS)
    - Use the Schema Conversion Tool(SCT) for heterogeneous migrations
        => ex) Oracle and RedShift is not compatible => first convert the schema, migrate the data, migate to RedShift
            => MySQL to Aurora is not compatible either
        => destination include Aurora, RedShift, DynamoDB and DocumentDB
            => On-Premises to Cloud 
        => source can be EC2 or RDS as well => Cloud to Cloud
    - Homogeneous migration; Development and Test; Database consolidation; continuous data replication
        
AWS Application Migration Service (MGN)
    - To migrate servers into EC2 instances 
    - Agentless snapshot-based replication is possible with the AWS MGN vCenter Client installed
        => but AWS recommend agent-based replication when possible
            => supports continuous data protection (CDP)
    - Highly automated lift-and-shift (rehost) solution for migrating applications to AWS
    - Utilizes continuous, block-level replication and enables short cutover windows measured in minutes
        => minimize downtime for servers that must be migrated to AWS 
    - SMS is older service and AWS recommend using MGN instead of SMS
    - Integrates with Cloud Migration Factory for orchestrating manual processes
    - can migrate virtual and physical servers
    
AWS Server Migration Service (SMS)
    - utilizes incremental, snapshot-based replication and enables cutover windows measured in hours
    - migrates VMware vSphere, Hyper-V and Azure virtual machines to EC2
    - can migrate application migration: database server, app server, web server to SMS; 
        => SMS creates AMI / CloudFormation (Template) => then forms EC2 instance group
    
AWS DataSync
    - migrate from NAS/File Servers to S3/EFS 
    - From Shared File System or Object Storage to S3, FSx or EFS
    - Data is encrypted in transit with TLS
    - Scheduled, automated data transfer 
    - support AWS Snowcone => install DataSync agent on Snowcone
    - support S3 on Outposts 
    - can copy data between: Network File System, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), etc..
    - pay per-GB transferred and storage
    
AWS Snow Family
    - Snowball and Snowmobile are used for migrating large volumes of data to AWS
        => for LARGE volume (10s-100sTB); for small internet link (GB/sec);
        => for highly burdened internet and they don't want to affect the existing internet link
    - load huge volumes of data onto it quickly; transport it physically to AWS; then to S3
    - Snowball is a device (80TB/50TB "petabyte scale"); Snowball Edge (100TB "petabyte scale")
    - Snowmobile is a truck with a container in the back (100PB "exabyte scale")
    - Snowball Edge Compute Optimized: Snowball device optimized for edge computing
        => Provides block and object storage and optional GPU 
        => maybe you have a factory where you don't have internet, but you need to collet data from sensor
        => uses EC2 to process data at the edge and store it for transportation
    - Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device
        => provides block storage and S3-compatible object storage 
    -Snowcone: small device used for edge computing, storage and data transfer
        => send data to S3, EFS, FXs for Windows file server
    - Cloud data migration; content distribution; tactical edge computing; machine learning; manufacturing; remote location with cimple data
        
The 7 Rs of Migration
    (Least Effort to Most Effort)
    - Retire = no longer needed, get rid of it
    - Retain = Leave as is (revisit at a later date)
    - Relocate = Move without modification (lift & shift); in the on-premise world
    - Rehost = OS/App moved to another host system (lift & shift ); AWS term as lift&shift
        => in reality you will modify something => lift, modify & shift
        => AWS MGN, SMS and VM Import/Export 
    - Repurchase = Use a different solution (e.g. SaaS) (ex. on-premise CRM to SalesForce)
    - Replatform = ex) database to RDS; server to Elastic Beanstalk; may require refactoring; schema updates...
        => AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) and Schema Conversion Tool(SCT)
        => migrate EB using custom AMI, or code-level migration
        => moderate development and migration effort 
    - Refactor = Re-architect to a cloud-native serverless architecture
        => utilizing full power of the cloud 
        => serverless services and event-driven architecture patterns 
        => from tranditional server to serverless cloud is going to require A LOT OF effort
    - Rehost, Replatform, Refactor is relevant to AWS
