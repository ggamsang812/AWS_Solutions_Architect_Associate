    Lesson - Docker Container and Microservices
        - Every VM/instance needs an operating system which uses significant resources
        - Docker Containers shares OS and Docker Engine 
            => Container includes all the code, settings and dependencies for running the application
            => each container is isolated from other containers 
            => size is very small compare to having the entire OS => starts up very quickly; resource efficient
        - Microservices can be spread across hosts / many instances of each microservices can run on each host

    Lesson - Amazon Elastic Container Service(ECS)
        - ECS Task is a running Docker container => An ECS Task is created from Task Definition
        - Docker images are stored in Amazon Elastic Container Registry(ECR) / Docker Hub
            => images are the files/code that get brought down to run the containers 
        - When task is launched, it's going to pull the image from the registry defined in the Task Definition
        - ECS Services are used to maintain a desired count of tasks => can use Auto Scaling Group 
        - Serverless with AWS Fargate - managed for you and fully scalable; no underlying infrastructure
        - Fully managed container orchestration - control plane is managed for you => no need to build it 
        - Docker support - full support for Docker containers; can use Docker Compose CLI
        - Windows container support
        - Elastic Load Balancing integration - distribute traffic across containers using ALB or NLB for EC2
        - Amazon ECS Anywhere (NEW - Not on test) - enables the use of Amazon ECS control plane to manage on-premises implementations
        - Cluster = Logical grouping of EC2 instances
        - Container instance = EC2 instance running the ECS agent
        - Task Definition = Blueprint that describes how a docker container should launch
        - Task = Running container using settings in a Task Definition
        - Service = Long running tasks - how many tasks are running; can control task count with Auto Scaling and attach an ELB
