Secion 6
    Lesson 1 - Introduction
        - VPC is a logically isolated potion of the AWS Cloud which you can deploy your own AWS resources in a private space
    
    Lesson 2 - The AWS Global Infrastructure
        - Building blocks of AWS Cloud around the world
        - AZ composed of one or more data centers
        - Region is a physical location in the world and is independent 
        - multiple AZ in each region
        
        - AWS Outposts => hardware from AWS that you can deploy AWS instances in your own data center => also able to conntect to AWS region and resources
        - AWS Local Zone => when you need low latency between your application and data center 
        - AWS Wavelength Zone => for 5G conntectivity with mobile with low latency
        - Amazon CloudFront Origins, Edge Cache, Edge location => for video 

        - Launch virtual servers and databases globally very easily

    Lesson 3 - IPv4 Addressing Primer
        - CIDR => technic so we can subdivide our networks into the ones that have the right balance of number of network that we have and the number of host per network
    Lesson 4 - Amazon VPC Overview
        - VPC router takes care of routing within the VPC and outside of the VPC => we don't really see this, we see route table
        - Have one internet gateway attached per VPC and used to connect to the internet
        - You can create multiple VPCs within each region (can create upto 5)
            => each VPC has a different block of IP address/CIDR(Classless Interdomain Routing)  => each subnet has a block of IP addresses from the CIDR block
        - Egress-only Internet Gateway => for IPv6

    Lesson 5 - Defining VPC CIDR Blocks
        - https://www.site24x7.com/tools/ipv4-subnetcalculator.html 
        - CIDR block size can be between /16 and /28
        - Ensure you have enough networks and hosts => you get to decide this only once
        - Bigger CIDR blocks are typically better (more flexibility)
        - Smaller subnets are OK for most use cases
        - Consider deploying application tiers per subnet
        - VPC Peering, across all VPC in all Regions / accounts you want to connect requires non-overlapping CIDR blocks
            => just avoid overlapping CIDR blocks
