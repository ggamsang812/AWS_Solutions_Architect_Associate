Section 3 - EC2
  Lesson 4 - When you're trying to connect to EC2 using SSH
    0. First you need to install a open SSH client  
    1. Put the .pem file where you can see the .pem file(key) when you type in ls on the ssh and .pem shows up
    2. On your ssh, run the following: ssh -i "us-east-kp.pem" ec2-user@ec2-52-3-220-153.compute-1.amazonaws.com
    3. You might run into this warning: WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!
      -> it means we need to change the permission on the file and this is something you might need to do if you're on a linux or a mac machine
      -> Do this: chmod 600 us-east-kp.pem
    4. Rerun the step2 command again. 

  Lesson 5 - RDP to Windows instances
    0. Windows instances is listening for connections on the remote desktop protocol port which is 3389
    1. Security group will have to have the RDP in the inboud rules
    2. You will need your own RDP client
    3. Public DNS, User Name and Password when you "Connect to instance" -> RDP client ; will be needed
      - For Password, you will need to provide .pem by clicking "Get password"
    3. Public DNS will be the "Computer" part and maybe go to details and edit the user name to the User Name and password to the Password from above

  Lesson 6 - User Data and Metadata
    User Data - gives you the ability to run command when the instance starts up
    Metadata - return the information about the instance that's recorded locally (like public-ipv4)

  Lesson 9 - Access Keys and IAM Roles
    - To remove credentials saved in EC2 or your PC when you ran "aws configure" :
        => cd to .aws folder
        => rm -rf *
    - There is an image file that shows the risk of using access keys to access services
    - Access Keys are associated with the IAM user
    - With the role, You make the IAM role with the right policy and attach it to the EC2
      => EC2 will now have access to whatever's in the role policy

  Lesson 10 - Status Checks and Monitoring
    - System status checks(if this doesn't pass, there is something wrong with the underlying hardware, therefore will need attention from AWS) & Instance status Checks(AWS is checking software and the network configuration of your EC2 instance itself - making sure your operating system is configured correctly, etc.. - Your(AWS customer's) involovment will be needed)

  Lesson 11 - EC2 Placement Groups
    - Cluster => Low-latency, tightly-coupled, HPC applications => one AZ
    - Partition => do not share underlying hardware, distributed and replicated workloads (you want other partitions to be running when others fail), Hadoop, Cassandra, and Kafka => within AZ or across AZ upto 7 but separate AWS rack
    - Spread => distinct underlying hardware => separate AWS rack => failure of one never effects others

  Lesson 12 - Network Interfaces
    - ENIs can be in different subnets within the same AZ; not across different AZs
    - Elastic network interface (ENI) - Normal use
    - Elastic network adapter (ENA) - higher bandwidth and lower latency; must choose supported instance type
    - Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) - for high performance computing and MPI and ML use cases; tightly coupled application; all instance types can use

  Lesson 13 - Public, Private and Elastic IP Addresses
    - Public IP address is dynamic, so it will have different address whenever you start your instance
    - Private stays the same
    - Elastic IP is public but static address and can be assigned to our network interface
      => you are charged if not used 
      => associated with a private IP address on the instance 
      => can be moved between instances and ENA 
      => if the instance fails, you can move the ENI that has EIP to the new instance / if the instances are in seperate AZ, then you can move only the EIP to the ENI in different AZ

  Lesson 14 - Network Address Translation(NAT) for Public Addresses
    - While you're in the instance, you won't be able to find the public IP address.
    - This is because your instance doesn't know about the public IP address; it only know the private IP address
    - The public IP address is associated with the ethernet interface and ENI/ENA is asoociated with the private IP address.
    - Internet Gateway(IGW) performs 1:1 NAT which means when a packet goes out from your instance it will have src address of the private IP and dest address to whatever => IGW will NAT the private IP to public IP in the packet and send out to dest address
    - When packet comes back from dest, the packet will have public IP as dest address => IGW will NAT public IP to private => to the instance
